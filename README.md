The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals includes a target for making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, 
resilient, and sustainable (Goal 11). A key outcome of this goal is to provide opportunities for safe and affordable housing.
The housing situation in Ghana is far from the SDG target described above. As a result, it would be interesting to investigate
the housing situation in Ghana and provide an understanding of the housing situation. The goal of this project therefore, is
to use such an understanding to provide a description of places in the country that provide the best options for budget accommodation.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

In this project, analysis is conducted on two datasets; apartment for rent and house for sale. 
The project focuses on two major cities in Ghana namely Accra and Kumasi. 
In each of the datasets, the analysis is conducted separately for Kumasi and Accra respectively.

OBJECTIVES

1. The suburb with the highest average rent price
2. The average rent price for each suburb
3. The most affordable and expensive suburb in Accra and Kumasi

FINDING
